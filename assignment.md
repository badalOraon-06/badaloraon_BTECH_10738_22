SDE Assignment
Task Management System (Kanban Based)
Obj ective
The objective of this assignment is to design and develop a full-stack Task Management
application with user authentication and a Kanban-style task board.
The primary focus should be on:
Clean and maintainable code
Reusability
End-to-end functionality
Evaluation Criteria
Code quality and structure
Plagiarism
Folder organization
Code reusability
Completeness Of functionality
Error handling
Documentation quality
Git usage and commit history

Backend Requirements
Candidates must build a RESTful API using one Of the following:
Python
Node.js
Java
Authentication & User Management
The application must support:
User Sign Up, Login, Logout
Update & Delete user profile
Task Management
Implement full CRUD operations for tasks.
Each task must contain:
title
description
status (pending / in-progress / completed)
due_date
created_at
Functional Requirements:
Tasks must be user-specific
API should support filtering tasks by status
General Backend Expectations
Proper API routing and folder structure
Input validation with meaningful error responses
Include a README.md with setup and run instructions

Frontend Requirements (Kanban View)
User Actions
Users should be able to:
Edit profile details
Login and logout
Perform task actions via the Kanban board
Kanban Board
The board must have three columns:
1. Pending
2. In Progress
3. Completed
Each task card should display:
Title
Short description
Due date
Tasks must be fetched from the backend and placed according to their status.
Drag & Drop
Users should be able to drag and drop tasks between sections
Status updates must persist via backend API calls
UI Expectations
Minimal styling
Any CSS framework is allowed
Application must be mobile responsive

Repository
Create a single Git repository containing both frontend and backend code.
o
Repository name must follow the format: yourname_rollnumber
o
Branching & Commits
o Use meaningful commit messages.
o Avoid committing unnecessary or autogenerated files (e.g., node_modules,
. env).
o Commit code incrementally to show development progress.
README Documentation
The repository must include a README. md containing:
O
o
o
O
o
O
Project overview
Tech stack used
Backend setup instructions
Frontend setup instructions
Environment variables configuration
API overview (optional but recommended)
Screenshots or demo link (if available)
Environment Configuration
o Use environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, secrets).
Include a . env . example file with required keys.
o
Database
Database choice is flexible (SQL / NoSQL).
o
o Provide migration or seed instructions if applicable.
Authentication
Protected routes must not be accessible without authentication.
o
o Token/ session handling should be secure and properly implemented.
Error Handling
Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
o
o Return meaningful ITITP status codes and error messages.
Testing (Optional but Preferred)
o Unit tests or API tests are a plus.
o Provide instructions on how to run tests if included.
Deployment (Optional)
Hosted demo (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, etc.) is a plus.
o
Include deployed URLs in the README if available.
o
IO. Submission
o Submit the Git repository link before the deadline.
o Ensure the project runs without errors using the provided instructions.
